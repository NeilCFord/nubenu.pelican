For all his sins, Lance Armstrong did do some occasional good, one instance of which was an advert for Radio Shack in which he said "No man over the age of 30 will ever use emoticons â€” no colon parentheses smiley faces . . ."

As a man over the age of 30, this is a rule that I have tried to live by for the last few years. I'd like to think with some success. But as the title of this blog suggests, I have a fairly unique sense of humour and I do wonder if occasionally some of the things I say online should be accompanied by some indicator that they maybe shouldn't be taken as seriously as people might be inclined to.

As I enter my sixth decade I'm thinking I might just relax my adherence to this rule. Maybe I'll experiment a little and see how it goes.
